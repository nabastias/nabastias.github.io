I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), with experience in policy analysis and causal methods for applied empirical research. My fields of interest include Applied Microeconomics and Econometrics, with a focus on development economics, social inequalities, and causal inference. I have previously worked on projects involving microeconometrics, machine learning, and the impact evaluation of microentrepreneurship programs in Chile.
