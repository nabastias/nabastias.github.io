<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I am a Predoctoral Research Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR), where I study the causes and consequences of health inequality under the mentorship of Professor Marcella Alsan. 
</div>
  
<div style="text-align: justify;">
  I obtained a B.A. in Economics (with honors) from the Universidad de Chile in 2024. Before joining Professor Alsanâ€™s research team, I worked on projects involving microeconometrics, machine learning, and the impact evaluation of microentrepreneurship programs in Chile (RCTs). I have experience in policy analysis and causal methods for applied empirical research, and I have served as a teaching assistant in courses on microeconomics, data analysis, and econometrics at the Universidad de Chile. My research interests include applied microeconomics and econometrics, with a focus on development economics, social inequalities, and causal inference.
